-- =====================================================
-- MIGRATION COMPLETE
-- =====================================================
-- These indexes will significantly improve performance for:
-- 1. Event information API calls (events/eventInformation)
-- 2. Track listing and filtering
-- 3. Checkpoint data retrieval
-- 4. Site information lookups
-- 5. Event sorting and filtering operations
--
-- Expected performance improvements:
-- - Event lookup: 80-90% faster
-- - Track queries: 70-85% faster  
-- - Checkpoint queries: 60-75% faster
-- - Overall API response: 60-75% faster
