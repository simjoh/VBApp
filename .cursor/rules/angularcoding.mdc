Refrerence angualar code style on link below 

https://angular.dev/style-guide


Dont use older angular coding style and and example. i dont want example earlier then angular 15
 

# frontend
## Admin for randonneur events events in focus
 ###  Style as professional admin system
 ###  Try to centralize style as a designsystem aproach isntead of spread it
 ###  Only for admin superuser  developer, volonteers and acp representant. Still competitor is bundle but its deprecated. should be removed in nomvember 2025, frontend-rider replaces the bundle one. maintain competitor part  if needed until it will be removed


# Brevet-rider
brevet-rider project should use angular 20 coding standards with standalone component and signals if possible


## brevet-rider is big focus on mobile experience
 ### Important that gelocation works well 
 ### Bettery consumtion is also in focus
 ### Easy usage due to users diffrent knowlegde
 ### Only for competitor not admin
