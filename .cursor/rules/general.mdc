when fixing errors and try to fix issues always try to fix the main problem and dont try to write code that not solve the main problem

if you need a jwt token use   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "APIKEY: notsecret_developer_key" -d '{"username":"bethem92@gmail.com","password":"cessna172"}' http://localhost:8090/api/login

skip db-1 and db-2 if trying to conect to db. use .env
